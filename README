NAME
	autohaltd 1.0 - Bring the system down when it is inactive

SYNOPSIS
	autohaltd [OPTION]... [-- [SHUTDOWN_ARGUMENT]...]

DESCRIPTION
	autohaltd automatically shuts down the computer (power off),
	when noone has been login for a long enough time.

OPTIONS
	-h, --help
		Print usage information.

	-v, --version
		Print program name and version.

	-c, --copyright
		Print copyright information.

	Any argument added after '--' is passed to shutdown(8).
	'-h' and 'now' will  always be passed, at the end. You
	cannot add a warning message, as this would have to be
	added after 'now'. However, a warning message is
	unnecessary, as the computer will shutdown immediately,
	and there should not be any users on the machine when
	this happens.

RATIONALE
	In environments where the number of computers is large,
	you can save on the environment and save money by
	turning of computers that are not used.

SEE ALSO
