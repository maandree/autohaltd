.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B autohalt
.RI [ OPTION ]...\ [ INTERVAL ]...\ [\fB\-\-\fP\ [ SHUTDOWN_ARGUMENT ]...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B autohalt
shuts down the machine (power off), if noone has been
logged in for a long enough time.
.PP
.B autohalt
shuts down the machine only if the sum of
.I INTERVAL
has elapsed since the last user logout. Each
.I INTERVAL
must be a non-negative integer, optionally with a unit:
.TP
.B s
Seconds.
.TP
.B m
Minutes (default). Note that it is
.BR m ,
not
.BR min .
.TP
.B h
Hours.
.PP
Any argument added after
.B \-\-
is passed to
.BR shutdown (8).
.B -h
and
.B now
will always be passed, at the end. You cannot add
a warning message, as this would have to be added
after
.BR now .
However, a warning message is unnecessary, as the
computer will shutdown immediately, and there should
not be any users on the machine when this happens.
